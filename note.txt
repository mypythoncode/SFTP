Here is an example of how you could design and code a method for managing an external IP whitelist for external SFTP push in AWS using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):

1.Create a new AWS IAM user with permissions to access the necessary resources (e.g. S3 bucket, VPC endpoint, etc.).

2.Use the Boto3 SDK to create a new VPC endpoint for the SFTP service, and associate it with the appropriate security group.

3.Create a new security group and configure it to only allow incoming connections from IP addresses that are on the whitelist.

4.Create a new Lambda function using the Boto3 SDK that will be triggered when an external IP address attempts to connect to the SFTP endpoint.

5.In the Lambda function, check the incoming IP address against the whitelist. If the IP address is not on the whitelist, deny the connection and log the attempt. If the IP address is on the whitelist, allow the connection and log the successful connection.
6.Create a new CloudWatch event that will trigger the Lambda function each time a connection is attempted to the SFTP endpoint.



#Here is a method for managing an external IP whitelist for external SFTP push in AWS:

Create a new AWS IAM user with permissions to access the necessary resources (e.g. S3 bucket, VPC endpoint, etc.).

Create a new security group and configure it to only allow incoming connections from IP addresses that are on the whitelist.

Use the Boto3 SDK to create a new VPC endpoint for the SFTP service and associate it with the security group created in step 2.

Create a new Lambda function using the Boto3 SDK that will be triggered when an external IP address attempts to connect to the SFTP endpoint.

In the Lambda function, check the incoming IP address against the whitelist. If the IP address is not on the whitelist, deny the connection and log the attempt. If the IP address is on the whitelist, allow the connection and log the successful connection.

Create a new CloudWatch event that will trigger the Lambda function each time a connection is attempted to the SFTP endpoint.

Create a new S3 bucket to store the whitelist and configure the Lambda function to read the whitelist from this bucket.

Create a new AWS Step Function to automate the update of the whitelist. This step function should include the following steps:


Read the new whitelist from a specified S3 bucket.
Validate the whitelist.
Update the security group with the new whitelist.
Send a notification to the administrator that the whitelist has been updated successfully.


Create a new CloudWatch event rule to trigger the step function periodically or on a schedule that fits your needs.

Create a new CloudTrail trail to track all SFTP endpoint access and any update on the whitelist.

Please note that this is just a high-level example and would require additional code and configuration to fully implement in a production environment. Also, this is just an example, you could have your own implementation using different services or libraries to achieve the same result.











Code snippet to create a security group which only allow incoming connections from IP addresses that are on the whitelist:



Copy code

import boto3

# Create a new security group
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.create_security_group(
    Description='My SFTP Whitelist',
    GroupName='MySFTPWhitelist'
)

# Get the ID of the newly created security group
group_id = response['GroupId']

# Add an inbound rule to the security group to only allow incoming connections from IP addresses on the whitelist
whitelist = ['111.111.111.111/32', '222.222.222.222/32']
for ip in whitelist:
    ec2.authorize_security_group_ingress(
        GroupId=group_id,
        IpProtocol='tcp',
        FromPort=22,
        ToPort=22,
        CidrIp=ip
    )
    
    
    
    
    
    
 
    
    
Please note that this is a high-level example and would require additional code and configuration to fully implement in a production environment.
Also this is just an example, you could have your own implementation.



   import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Get the incoming IP address from the event data
    ip_address = event['sourceIPAddress']

    # Get the whitelist from the environment variables
    whitelist = os.environ['WHITELIST'].split(',')

    # Check if the incoming IP address is on the whitelist
    if ip_address in whitelist:
        # Allow the connection and log the successful connection
        print(f'Allowing connection from {ip_address}')
        return
    else:
        # Deny the connection and log the attempt
        print(f'Denying connection from {ip_address}')
        raise Exception('Connection from IP address not on whitelist')
